# Manuscript Yield Data - Source of Truth for FVS-Python Validation
# =================================================================
# Data extracted from: "Toward a timber asset account for the United States:
#                       A pilot account for Georgia"
# Authors: Bruck, Mihiar, Mei, Brandeis, Chambers, Hass, Wentland, Warziniack
#
# This data represents official FVS Southern Variant outputs used in the
# timber asset account for Georgia. These values are considered the
# validation target for fvs-python.
#
# FVS Version: FS2025.1
# Simulation settings:
#   - Ages 0-40: 1-year increments
#   - Ages 40-90: 5-year increments
#   - Target TPA at age 20: 55-95 (varies by species)
#   - Conversion: 100 CCF = 2 tons (approximately)
#
# Note: CCF = cubic feet / 100 (hundred cubic feet)
