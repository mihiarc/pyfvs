  notes: |
    These values reflect the actual FVS-SN model behavior with default ecounit (232).
    The 232 ecounit is the Georgia baseline with coefficient 0.0.
    For higher growth rates matching typical yield tables, use ecounit='M231'.
    See CLAUDE.md for detailed ecounit effects on growth.
